            <p>
            No more weeping, no more blaming of any one up and doing it is time to arise and awake and stop not till the goal of economic independence of PCW achieved. Mere economic independence without having faith in values of life will never result in contented life. All our efforts will go along with infusing positive approach in PCW by following cardinal values of life.
